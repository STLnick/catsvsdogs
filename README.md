### Why it was built and "finished" this way

I wanted to make something with Go and Ebitengine. 2d art games are fun. I've been wanting to build more silly games. It was finished this way because I got what I wanted out of this little permutation. I learned about the Ebitengine package, its Game struct, how to use it, a bit of game loop structure, how to render sprites and animate them, how to draw and update text on the screen and countless other things that I messed up and learned not to do (unfortunately I won't remember them all).
